I am an Assistant Professor in Analytics and Information Systems at [Stevens School of Business](https://www.stevens.edu/school-of-business). Before joining Stevens, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Operations Research at [Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper), where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [John Hooker](http://public.tepper.cmu.edu/jnh). In addition, I obtained my B.S. degrees in Applied Mathematics and Business Administration from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu). 

My research interests are broadly related to fairness in optimization modeling and ethics in decision making. Some topics I am actively working on are: learning moral judgments and ethical preferences from people, end-to-end fairness optimization via decision-focused learning, fairness and equity in shared micromobility systems, structural understanding of fairness and efficiency symbiosis and tradeoffs, power gap and payment term in supply chain. 

<!--modeling fairness and equity in optimization, learning and inferring ethical preferences from people, social welfare perspectives of fairness in machine learning.-->

<!--Motivated by two fundamental questions, *what is fair* and *how to be fair*, I study a variety of fairness approaches and perspectives from optimization, machine learning, welfare economics and ethics. My projects aim to contribute insights about eliciting, formulating and operationalizing fairness and equity. -->

<!--My research interests are broadly related to fairness in various decision making frameworks and application domains. I study and utilize optimization as the main methodology. Motivated by two fundamental questions, what is fair and how to be fair, my projects seek to explore the use of optimization methods for formulating, attaining and understanding fairness.
